### Glorious Potato Factory event

<details><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event available this week that was quite addicting. It is based off Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It also has a really good soundtrack. I played the event for way too long today, and made it to rank 6. It is active next week as well, so I intend to play it further. - 2022 Saturday, March 5th

I continued to play the Glorious Potato Factory event again this week, unfortunately, I won't be making it past rank 9. Eventually, I ran out of things to do, and ran out of time. I am still hoping to get the soundtrack. This week, I went from rank 6 to rank 9. The event ends on Monday, so I won't be able to progress more. It was a good event. - 2022 Saturday March 13th

### Supreme Supervillain event

<details><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event available this week that was somewhat interesting. I played it, since it is here for 2 weeks, and because I have never played it before (since it is brand new) I played the event for way too long today, and made it to rank 4. It is active next week as well, so I intend to play it further. - 2022 Saturday, March 28th

I played the event heavily again this week, the event ends in less than 48 hours, so I just made it as far as I could. I went from rank 5 to rank 7, 7 out of 8 quests completed. I could have made it to rank 8, but I received an `upgrade 2 cards` quest after I spent nearly all my dark science. It is fine, I don't use gold anyways, and 10 gold isn't very much. - 2022, Saturday, June 4th

## Past issues

<details><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

### HyperHippo ad controversy (2022 March 26th - 2022 July 16th)

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, and Vacation Tycoon (newly released) which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play.

It is looking like they are going to survive this controversy, but I can't be sure. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 July 16th.
