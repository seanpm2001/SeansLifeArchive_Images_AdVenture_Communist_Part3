# 2022, Tuesday, December 20th - Didn't play

I didn't play AdVenture Communist today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Saturday. I might start playing again on Saturday, 2022, December 24th.

I have been making plans for coming back. I feel I will need to finish my GitHub language acceleration project first to free up time. When I do come back, I plan to reduce the length of the sessions, even if little or inadequate progress is made. I am considering cutting the combined time of both games to a 2 hour period.

### HyperHippo ad controversy (2022 March 26th - 2022 July 16th)

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, and Vacation Tycoon (newly released) which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play.

It is looking like they are going to survive this controversy, but I can't be sure. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 July 16th.
